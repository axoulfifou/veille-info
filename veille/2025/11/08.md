Here’s what the 2025 Octoverse data says about how devs really work now. The post What 986 million code pushes say about the developer workflow in 2025 appeared first on The GitHub Blog . *(Source: github.blog)*
- **[Most DevSecOps Advice Is Useless without Context—Here’s What Actually Works](https://www.docker.com/blog/context-aware-devsecops-what-works/)** — Generic DevSecOps advice may sound good on paper, but it often fails in practice because it ignores team context, workflow, and environment-specific needs. Overloaded controls, broad policies, and misapplied tools disrupt the flow of development. And once flow breaks, security measures are the first to get bypassed. The way forward isn't more rules but smarter... *(Source: www.docker.com)*
- **[Dynamic MCPs with Docker: Stop Hardcoding Your Agents’ World](https://www.docker.com/blog/dynamic-mcps-stop-hardcoding-your-agents-world/)** — The MCP protocol is almost one year old and during that time, developers have built thousands of new MCP servers. Thinking back to MCP demos from six months ago, most developers were using one or two local MCP servers, each contributing just a handful of tools. Six months later and we have access to thousands... *(Source: www.docker.com)*
